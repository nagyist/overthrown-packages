Every player has one castle.  Your castle will have a green flag.  Enemies will have a red flag.  Neutral buidings a white one and allies a blue flag.

Castles produce workers and soldiers.

Workers are for building villages.  Soldiers for attacking cities or enemies.  Villages for collecting gold and producing soldiers.

The other type of building is a city.  There are 10 cities per map.  They start with a white flag.  To win the game an alliance must capture all cities.
