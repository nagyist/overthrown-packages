Villages collect resources from the surrounding squares and produce soldiers.

Use a worker to build a village but be careful, workers can be killed by enemy soldiers.  If they're killed they are created again automatically at their player's castle.  Max {{_s.numWorkersPerPlayer}} workers per player.

Workers build villages instantly and do not cost any gold.  When a worker is on a square where it can build a village a "Build Village" button will appear.

Villages collect resources from the 9 squares surrounding and under the village.  Brown squares produce nothing.  Light green squares produce 2 gold and dark green squares produce 6 gold.

Villages can hire soldiers and can be used as forward bases.

Buildings next to villages do not change the number of resources collected.  It is ok to build villages next to each other.

5 villages max.
