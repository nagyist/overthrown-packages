Soldiers can be hired at your castle and villages.

On the right side you will see a "Hire Soldiers" box.  This is where you set the number of soldiers you would like to hire. When the turn ends soldiers will be hired if you have gold, available gold is the gold already in your treasury plus the gold generated in the turn.  For example if you have 90 gold in your treasury and you produce 20 gold per turn you would be able to hire one soldier and have 10 gold remaining after the turn processes.

Buildings can produce 5 soldiers per turn max.
