Overthrown is a team game.  Players can team up by forming alliances with each other.

Max 5 players per alliance.

Players must be in an alliance before attacking a city.  Cities belong to alliances not to players.  Income from a city is divided evenly among all players in the alliance.

The winners of the game are the players in the winning alliance.  Anyone can create an alliance.  To create an alliance click on the alliance icon in the top left then fill out the form on the right.  To invite another player to your alliance click on their castle then the invite button.  The other player must accept your invitation.

Players in your alliance will have a blue flag.  Troops of players in an alliance will not fight each other.
